    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained inside the pre_process function block.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because it will decrease the influence of the image's brightness. For example, the image of a traffic sign under the sunshine has differenct RGB with the image of the same sign in the night, but the gray are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I normalized the image data by deviding the image by 255 so that every value is between 0 and 1. This eliminates large values, such as 255, making the training process more stable. \n",

The other wrong-detected sign is the 100 km/h sign, which is classified to be a 30 km/h sign. So I think the model is not \"good at\" number recognition.\n",
